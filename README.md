  - Comment: *Just as the name, it is a very good starting-point book for Bayesian Statistics. Providing an abundance of examples and codes, the book demonstrates a fairly complete skeleton of Bayesian Statistics. 
  One thing can be a problem is that the code is not printed in typical code-like form which may cause subtle confusion*.
